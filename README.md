## Note

This was made by a person who primarily uses TypeScript and doesn't know how to use Python.

## How to

Simply add this to your README.md

```html
# ðŸŒ¸ My recent AniList activity

<!-- ANILIST_ACTIVITY:start -->

<!-- ANILIST_ACTIVITY:end -->
```

and setup the workflow like this:

```yml
name: AniList readme workflow
on:
    schedule:
        # Runs every hour
        - cron: "0 * * * *"
    workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
    update-readme-with-anilist:
        name: Update this repo's README with latest AniList activites
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:

> Note: I recommend you leave the default `commit_username` and `commit_email` \
> If you're unsure what's your User ID on AniList follow the quide below

## How to get my user id

Head on over to https://anilist.co/graphiql and input the query below and replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your username.

```gql
query {
	User(name: "YOUR_USERNAME") {
		id
		name
	}
}
```

The query above will return your username and your id which you can use for this action.
