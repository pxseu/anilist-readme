> Note: Eiter `user_id` or `user_name` is required! \

> For `date_format` months: {M} will result in a number (e.g '3') & {MW} will result in a string (e.g 'March') \
> If you're unsure what's your User ID on AniList follow the quide below

## How to get my user ID

If you change your username frequently or you're unsure what your user id is, you can use the AniList API to get it.
Head on over to https://anilist.co/graphiql and input the query below and replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your username.

```gql
query {
  User(name: "YOUR_USERNAME") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

The query above will return your username and your id which you can use for this action.
